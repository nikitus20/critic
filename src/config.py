# Critic prompt
CRITIC_PROMPT = """I will provide you with a question and a robot's answer, divided into several sections. Your task is to evaluate each section of the robot's answer for any errors.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Evaluate each section independently. Assess each section based solely on the accuracy and logic within that section.
- Do not consider subjective elements such as redundancy or stylistic preferences as errors.
- Do not consider corrections or reflections made in later sections. Even if a later section acknowledges and fixes an earlier mistake, the original section must still be marked as erroneous.
- If a subsequent section contains an error caused by an earlier section's mistake, do not count it as a new error.

**Output Format:**
- If you think all sections of the robot's answer are correct, output in the following format:  
    Conclusion: no error
- If you think any section contains an error, output in the following format:  
    Conclusion: yes
    Error Section Number: [section number]
    Explanation: [explanation for the error in this section]
    Error Section Number: [section number]
    Explanation: [explanation for the error in this section]
    â€¦ (repeat for each erroneous section)  

**Input:**
- Question: {question}
- Robot's Answer: {model_output}
- judge result: """
